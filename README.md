# Boss Ali-bah-bah?

Boss Ali-bah-bah? is a Progressive Web App (PWA) written with the Ruby on Rails framework. It was designed for migrant workers in Singapore to learn about their employment rights, keep proper documentation of their working hours, salary payments and medical bills and reports and seek help from non-profit organisations easily when they need it.

The app is live at https://boss-ali-bah-bah.herokuapp.com

## About

Boss Ali-bah-bah? is a final project as part of [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon)'s Full Stack Web Development bootcamp (Batch #537, Singapore).

It was initially pitched by Felicia in response to frequent cases of employers underpaying migrant workers their salary or workplace accident medical bills, and the low success rates of salary and injury compensation claims through the legal system.

The app aims to help workers know their rights and seek help early, as well as make a stronger legal case for their claims by keeping robust documentation of their employment in Singapore.
